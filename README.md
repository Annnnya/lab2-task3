# lab2-task3

The *task3.py* is a python program that creates a website.
The website asks to enter a Twitter username, as in the screen

Then if the username is right it redirects to a map where locations of friends of this twitter account are displayed (up to 100)

For proper work you must enter your bearer token in bt.env file, which must be in the same directory as task3.py.
Also this directory must contain templates directory with welcome.html file

I didn't share my token to the public repository, but it will not work without it
